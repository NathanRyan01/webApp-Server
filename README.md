# webApp-Server
Server side scripts

This application is a section covered in the already mentioned masters thesis.

The frontend is created using Angular 4, the backend is PHP which connects to a MySQL database.

The overall goal of the project is to compare both development and performance time along with usability testing for mobile applications developed 
using different approaches.

These approaches are web-based, native and hybrid based development.

Different scenarios such as interactions with a database, the computation involved during matrix multiplication and accessing a devices filesystem 
will be developed and compared. 

The testing tool used for performance is called GameBench. The development time will be captured by the coder. 

The Usability will be measured using a group of individuals.
